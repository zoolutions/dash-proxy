# Kamal Proxy - A minimal HTTP proxy for zero-downtime deployments


## What it does

Kamal Proxy is a tiny HTTP proxy, designed to make it easy to coordinate
zero-downtime deployments. By running your web applications behind Kamal Proxy,
you can deploy changes to them without interrupting any of the traffic that's in
progress. No particular cooperation from an application is required for this to
work.

Kamal Proxy is designed to work as part of [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/),
which provides a complete deployment experience including container packaging
and provisioning. However, Kamal Proxy could also be used standalone or as part
of other deployment tooling.


## A quick overview

To run an instance of the proxy, use the `dash-proxy run` command. There's no
configuration file, but there are some options you can specify if the defaults
aren't right for your application.

For example, to run the proxy on a port other than 80 (the default) you could:

    dash-proxy run --http-port 8080

Run `dash-proxy help run` to see the full list of options.

To route traffic through the proxy to a web application, you `deploy` instances
of the application to the proxy. Deploying an instance makes it available to the
proxy, and replaces the instance it was using before (if any).

Use the format `hostname:port` when specifying the instance to deploy.

For example:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000

This will instruct the proxy to register `web-1:3000` to receive traffic under
the service name `service1`. It will immediately begin running HTTP health
checks to ensure it's reachable and working and, as soon as those health checks
succeed, will start routing traffic to it.

If the instance fails to become healthy within a reasonable time, the `deploy`
command will stop the deployment and return a non-zero exit code, allowing
deployment scripts to handle the failure appropriately.

Each deployment takes over all the traffic from the previously deployed
instance. As soon as Kamal Proxy determines that the new instance is healthy,
it will route all new traffic to that instance.

The `deploy` command also waits for traffic to drain from the old instance before
returning. This means it's safe to remove the old instance as soon as `deploy`
returns successfully, without interrupting any in-flight requests.

Because traffic is only routed to a new instance once it's healthy, and traffic
is drained completely from old instances before they are removed, deployments
take place with zero downtime.

### Customizing the health check

By default, Kamal Proxy will test the health of each service by sending a `GET`
request to `/up`, once per second. A `200` response is considered healthy.

If you need to customize the health checks for your application, there are a
few `deploy` flags you can use. See the help for `--health-check-path`,
`--health-check-port`, `--health-check-timeout`, and `--health-check-interval`.

For example, to change the health check path to something other than `/up`, you
could:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --health-check-path web/index.html

To configure health checks to run on a different port than your main service
(useful when your app exposes health endpoints on a dedicated port), you could:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --health-check-port 8080

### Monitoring the proxy itself

The health checks above tell the proxy whether your *app* is up. To let an
external uptime monitor tell whether the *proxy* is up, there is a liveness
endpoint answered by the proxy itself:

    curl http://your-server/.kamal-proxy/ping
    # → 200 OK

Point your uptime monitor at that URL rather than at one of your apps, and a
page tells you the proxy is gone instead of blaming whichever service you
happened to pick as the canary.

Things worth knowing:

* **It answers before anything is deployed.** Liveness means this process is
  serving, so a freshly booted proxy with zero services answers `200` on plain
  HTTP — you do not need TLS, a host, or a deployment for it to work.
* **It answers on every host the proxy serves**, over HTTP and HTTPS alike, and
  is never forwarded upstream. `/.kamal-proxy/` is reserved by the proxy, so an
  app cannot serve its own page there.
* **It is not authenticated and not rate limited.** It reveals only that a
  dash-proxy is running on the port, which anyone connecting to the port can
  already tell. If you would rather it not be reachable from the internet,
  block the path at your edge.
* **It is not in the access log** and carries `Cache-Control: no-store`, so
  probing once a second costs you neither log volume nor a stale cached `200`.
* **There is no matching readiness endpoint.** The proxy restores its routing
  state before it opens a listener, and closes its listeners when draining, so
  a readiness probe here could only ever say `200`. Whether the port accepts a
  connection at all is the real signal.

### Host-based routing

Host-based routing allows you to run multiple applications on the same server,
using a single instance of Kamal Proxy to route traffic to all of them.

When deploying an instance, you can specify a host that it should serve traffic
for:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --host app1.example.com

When deployed in this way, the instance will only receive traffic for the
specified host. By deploying multiple instances, each with their own host, you
can run multiple applications on the same server without port conflicts.

Only one service at a time can route a specific host:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --host app1.example.com
    dash-proxy deploy service2 --target web-2:3000 --host app1.example.com # returns "Error: host is used by another service"
    dash-proxy remove service1
    dash-proxy deploy service2 --target web-2:3000 --host app1.example.com # succeeds


### Path-based routing

For applications that split their traffic to different services based on the
request path, you can use path-based routing to mount services under different
path prefixes.

For example, to send all the requests for paths begining with `/api` to web-1,
and the rest to web-2:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --path-prefix=/api
    dash-proxy deploy service2 --target web-2:3000

By default, the path prefix will be stripped from the request before it is
forwarded upstream. So in the example above, a request to `/api/users/123` will
be forwarded to `web-1` as `/users/123`. To instead forward the request with
the original path (including the prefix), specify `--strip-path-prefix=false`:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --path-prefix=/api --strip-path-prefix=false


### Excluding paths from metrics

When metrics are enabled (with `--metrics-port`), every request handled by
the proxy is recorded in the Prometheus output. High-volume traffic from
upstream load balancers or uptime monitors hitting health endpoints can
both inflate the metrics pipeline and dominate aggregate measures like
request rate, latency percentiles, and error rates, making the resulting
metrics a poor reflection of real user traffic.

To exclude one or more paths from the metrics for a service, use
`--exclude-metrics-path` when deploying. The flag may be repeated, and
matches are exact:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --exclude-metrics-path /up --exclude-metrics-path /healthz

Excluded requests are still logged; only the Prometheus counters and
in-flight gauge are skipped.

Paths are specified as the upstream receives them. Services deployed using
stripped path prefixes should specify their excluded paths in the un-prefixed
form.


### Choosing a log format

Logs are written as JSON by default. To write logfmt instead, start the proxy
with `--log-format` (or the `LOG_FORMAT` environment variable):

    dash-proxy run --log-format text

Accepted values are `json` and `text`; `logfmt` is accepted as a synonym for
`text`. The setting covers the whole process — the per-request access log and
the proxy's own startup, certificate and shutdown messages all go through the
same handler, so a log pipeline never has to parse two shapes at once.


### Correlating logs with distributed traces

If your clients or an upstream load balancer already send a W3C
[`traceparent`](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) header, the proxy reads it
and adds `trace_id`, `span_id` and `trace_flags` to that request's access log
line, so proxy logs join the trace your application is already recording. The
header itself is forwarded byte for byte.

This is on by default. Control it with `--trace-context` (or the
`TRACE_CONTEXT` environment variable):

    dash-proxy run --trace-context generate

| Value | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `off` | The header is neither read nor logged. It still reaches the target, like any other header. |
| `propagate` (default) | A valid incoming `traceparent` is logged and forwarded unchanged. A missing or malformed one is left exactly as it arrived. |
| `generate` | As `propagate`, and a request arriving without a valid `traceparent` gets a newly minted one, so every request downstream carries a trace id that the access log also names. |

The trace attributes appear only on requests that actually carry a trace, so
enabling this changes nothing about the log lines of a deployment that does not
trace.

`span_id` is the **caller's** span — the one your application will parent its
own spans to. The proxy deliberately does not mint a span of its own: it exports
no spans to any backend, so a span id invented here would leave your application
parented to a span that no tracing backend has ever seen.

Traces minted by `generate` are marked sampled (`trace_flags` `01`). The
alternative would be worse than not minting one at all — an application that
would otherwise have made its own sampling decision honours the parent's
instead, so an unsampled parent silently switches its tracing off. Use
`generate` when you want the proxy to be the start of the trace, and leave it at
`propagate` when your application already decides what to sample.

Per the spec, a request whose `traceparent` is malformed has its `tracestate`
dropped when `generate` replaces the header — that `tracestate` describes the
trace that was just discarded.


### Password-protecting a service

To put a service behind an HTTP Basic password prompt, deploy it with
`--basic-auth`:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --tls --host app.example.com --basic-auth admin:s3cr3t

Requests without valid credentials get a `401` and a browser password prompt.
The password is hashed by the CLI before it is sent to the proxy, so neither
the RPC socket nor the saved state file ever sees the plaintext.

Things worth knowing:

* **Use it with TLS.** Basic credentials are replayable and are re-sent on
  every request. On a service deployed with `--tls`, plaintext requests are
  redirected to HTTPS *before* any challenge is issued, so the password is
  never solicited in the clear. If you turn that redirect off with
  `--tls-redirect=false`, or deploy without `--tls` at all, the proxy logs a
  warning and challenges over plaintext — only do that when TLS is terminated
  in front of the proxy.
* **The health check path stays open.** `GET` and `HEAD` on the configured
  `--health-check-path` are served without credentials, so downstream load
  balancers can still see the service drain during a deploy. Deploying with
  both `--basic-auth` and a health check path of `/` is rejected, since that
  would leave the service's index page public.
* **The credential is removed before forwarding.** Your application never sees
  the proxy's `Authorization` header, so it cannot be logged by
  `--log-request-header authorization` or read by the upstream.
* **Rollout targets inherit it.** `dash-proxy rollout deploy` reuses the
  service's stored options, so rollout traffic stays protected.
* **Redeploying without the flag removes protection.** The credential is not
  sticky; a deploy that omits `--basic-auth` leaves the service open.
* **Rolling the proxy image back removes protection silently.** A binary older
  than this feature ignores the stored credential and the next state save drops
  it. Redeploy with `--basic-auth` after any proxy rollback.
* **The password reaches the deploy host's process table.** It is an ordinary
  command-line argument, so it is visible to `ps` and to anything that logs the
  command.
* **A per-path prefix is routing, not a security boundary.** You can protect
  part of a site by deploying it as its own `--path-prefix` service with its own
  credential, but prefix matching does not normalize paths — give the protected
  prefix a target that does not also serve the same content under an
  unprotected root.

If you use `--error-pages`, add a `401.html` to that directory; otherwise the
challenge falls back to the proxy's built-in plain response.


### Restricting a service by client address

To serve a service only to certain networks, deploy it with `--allow-ip`:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --allow-ip 10.0.0.0/8,203.0.113.7

Requests from anywhere else get a `403`. The flag takes addresses or CIDR
ranges, and may be repeated or comma-separated. Metrics have their own list:

    dash-proxy run --metrics-port 9090 --metrics-allow-ip 10.0.0.0/8

Things worth knowing:

* **It matches the address that connected**, not any header. `X-Forwarded-For`
  and friends are written by the client, so honouring them by default would
  make the list decorative — anyone could send `X-Forwarded-For: 10.0.0.1`.
* **Behind a load balancer or CDN, say so with `--trusted-proxy`.** Only when
  the connecting address is inside one of those ranges is the forwarded chain
  consulted, and then the client is the nearest address in the chain that none
  of your proxies wrote. **List every hop, not just the one that connects to
  dash-proxy** — behind a CDN in front of a load balancer, list both, or the
  CDN's edge address becomes the one matched against `--allow-ip`.
* **If the chain cannot be resolved, the request is denied.** A trusted edge
  that stops sending the header denies everything rather than silently falling
  back to the edge's own address, which would be a bypass whenever your allow
  list contains the proxy's own range. Denials are logged with the address the
  decision used and why, rate-limited per service.
* **List your IPv6 ranges too.** A client reaching the proxy over IPv6 is
  matched on its IPv6 address; an IPv4-only list denies it. The proxy warns at
  deploy when a list has no IPv6 ranges. (`::ffff:` forms of IPv4 addresses are
  matched against IPv4 ranges, so those do not need listing separately.)
* **The health check path stays open**, so downstream load balancers can still
  see the service drain during a deploy. Deploying with both `--allow-ip` and a
  health check path of `/` is rejected.
* **`--client-ip-header` requires `--trusted-proxy`.** Without it the deploy is
  rejected, because the header would be ignored while appearing to be honoured.
  With it, be sure the header names one your edge *overwrites or strips* on
  every request — a header the edge merely passes through can be set by anyone.
* **Redeploying without the flag removes the restriction**, and rolling the
  proxy image back to a version without this feature removes it silently.
* **Check what the proxy actually sees.** The access log's `client_addr` is the
  connecting address; `remote_addr` is the client's own claim and is not what
  the filter uses. Under some Docker port drivers every request appears to come
  from the bridge gateway, in which case a list cannot distinguish anyone.
* **A `--path-prefix` service is routing, not a security boundary** — the same
  caveat as basic auth above.

If you use `--error-pages`, add a `403.html` to that directory.

### Denying abusive clients

An allow list is the wrong shape for a service the whole internet is meant to
reach. When a scraper or a misbehaving bot is hammering a public service right
now, deploy it with deny rules instead:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --deny-ip 203.0.113.0/24
    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --deny-user-agent 'BadBot/.*'

Matching requests get a `403`. `--deny-ip` takes addresses or CIDR ranges and
may be repeated or comma-separated. `--deny-user-agent` takes an RE2 pattern
matched against the full `User-Agent` value, compiled once at deploy, and may
be repeated (but not comma-separated — patterns can contain commas).

Things worth knowing:

* **The client is resolved exactly as it is for `--allow-ip`** — the connecting
  address unless `--trusted-proxy` says the peer is yours, in which case the
  forwarded chain is walked with the same rules. Denying the connecting peer
  behind a trusted load balancer would deny everyone.
* **Deny runs first.** Before the allow list (an address on both lists is
  denied), before the TLS redirect (a `403` solicits nothing), before the rate
  limit (a denied client never spends budget), and before basic auth (a denied
  network never learns credentials are wanted).
* **IPv6 addresses are matched exactly as written** — an explicit address
  denies that address alone, with none of the rate limiter's `/64` grouping. A
  deny names exactly what you wrote; write the CIDR if you mean the network.
* **A missing `User-Agent` is not a crime.** Only an explicit `^$` pattern
  denies requests that send no `User-Agent` at all — even `.*` does not.
  Patterns match the whole header value: `BadBot/.*` means that agent, not any
  agent mentioning it somewhere.
* **The health check path stays open**, and deploying deny rules with a health
  check path of `/` is rejected, same as `--allow-ip`.
* **Denials are counted** in the `kamal_proxy_denials_total` metric, labeled by
  service and rule kind (`ip`, `user_agent`), and logged rate-limited per
  service.
* **Redeploying without the flags removes the block.** Rules live in the
  service's deploy options like every other knob.

If you use `--error-pages`, add a `403.html` to that directory.

### Rate limiting a service per client

To cap how fast a single client may hit a service, deploy it with
`--rate-limit`:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --rate-limit 20

Requests over the limit get a `429` with a `Retry-After` header. The limit is
requests per second and may be fractional (`--rate-limit 0.5` is one request
every two seconds). Clients may also spend a burst back to back before the rate
applies — by default the rate rounded up, or set it explicitly:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --rate-limit 20 --rate-limit-burst 100

Monitoring and internal networks can be exempted:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --rate-limit 20 --rate-limit-exempt 10.0.0.0/8

Things worth knowing:

* **Behind a load balancer or CDN, set `--trusted-proxy`.** Without it every
  request carries the balancer's address, so the whole internet shares one
  bucket and the first burst locks everyone out. The client is resolved exactly
  as it is for `--allow-ip`, with the same rules about listing every hop and the
  same refusal to trust a header from an untrusted peer.
* **IPv6 clients are counted per `/64`, not per address.** Every IPv6 client
  holds at least a `/64` and can pick a fresh source address for each request,
  so counting whole addresses would let anyone walk straight past the limit. A
  `/64` is the smallest allocation guaranteed to be one subnet, so this does not
  charge one customer for another's traffic. IPv4 is counted per address.
* **Redirects are free.** A `301` from `--tls` or `--canonical-host` never
  reaches your app, so it does not spend a token — `--rate-limit 20` means
  twenty real requests per second, not ten plus their redirects.
* **It applies before the basic auth challenge**, so `--basic-auth` and
  `--rate-limit` together bound password guessing. Failed attempts spend budget.
* **The health check path stays open**, so a downstream load balancer's probes
  are never throttled — a `429` there reads as "down". Deploying with both
  `--rate-limit` and a health check path of `/` is rejected.
* **Memory is bounded.** Up to 50,000 clients are counted individually; past
  that, further clients share one bucket rather than going uncounted. Idle
  clients are forgotten once their budget has fully refilled, which by then
  carries no information.
* **Budgets are per service and reset on redeploy**, since the limiter is
  rebuilt with the service's options.
* **This is an application-level limit, not DDoS protection.** It protects your
  app from a busy or abusive client; it does not protect the proxy's own
  listener from a flood, which needs something in front of it.

If you use `--error-pages`, add a `429.html` to that directory.


### Preserving client addresses behind a load balancer

An L4 load balancer (a DigitalOcean load balancer, an AWS NLB) replaces every
connection's source address with its own, which blinds the access log,
`X-Forwarded-For`, and `--allow-ip`. If the balancer can send the [PROXY
protocol](https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt), run the
proxy with `--proxy-protocol` to read the client address it forwards:

    dash-proxy run --proxy-protocol --proxy-protocol-allow-ip 10.0.0.0/8

Things worth knowing:

* **The header is optional per connection.** Connections that do not start
  with a PROXY preamble are served on their own address, so balancer health
  checks and direct probes keep working whether or not they send it.
* **Restrict who may assert an address.** A PROXY header is just bytes; any
  peer that can reach the port could send one and impersonate another client.
  `--proxy-protocol-allow-ip` lists the addresses or CIDR ranges (your
  balancer's private ranges) whose headers are honoured — anyone else's header
  is read and discarded, and the connection is served on its real address.
  Leaving the list empty trusts every peer, which is only safe when nothing
  but the balancer can reach the proxy's ports.
* **It applies to the HTTP and HTTPS listeners.** The preamble is read before
  the TLS handshake, as the protocol requires. The metrics listener never
  parses PROXY headers — `--metrics-allow-ip` matches the connecting address,
  and honouring a spoofable header there would undermine it. HTTP/3 runs over
  UDP, which the stream-based PROXY protocol does not cover; front it with an
  L7 balancer or leave `--http3` off behind an NLB.
* **`--allow-ip` composes with it.** Once the real client address is restored,
  service allow lists match against it directly — no `--trusted-proxy`
  configuration is needed for the balancer hop itself.
* **Both versions of the protocol are accepted** (v1 text and v2 binary),
  which covers DigitalOcean and AWS balancers without further configuration.


### Rewriting request and response headers

Security headers, CORS, and anything else your app would otherwise have to ship
itself can be set at the proxy. Each direction has three verbs, and every flag
may be given more than once:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 \
      --set-response-header 'Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains' \
      --set-response-header "Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'" \
      --remove-response-header Server \
      --set-request-header 'X-Env: production'

| Verb | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--set-{request,response}-header '<name>: <value>'` | Replaces any existing values |
| `--add-{request,response}-header '<name>: <value>'` | Appends, keeping existing values |
| `--remove-{request,response}-header <name>` | Drops every value |

Things worth knowing:

* **Rules run remove → set → add**, not in the order the flags appear. Naming a
  header under both `--remove-response-header` and `--set-response-header`
  therefore leaves the value you set, whichever flag you typed first.
* **Response rules cover what your app returned.** Responses the proxy produces
  itself — error pages, the `--tls`/`--canonical-host` redirect, a `401` from
  `--basic-auth`, a `429` from `--rate-limit` — never reach your app and keep
  the proxy's own headers. This matches nginx's `add_header` default.
* **Request rules have the last word over `X-Forwarded-*`.** They are applied
  after the proxy sets those, so `--set-request-header 'X-Forwarded-Proto:
  https'` wins. They do not apply to health checks, which the proxy issues
  itself; use `--health-check-host` if a probe needs a particular `Host`.
* **Quote the value.** A value containing spaces or a comma needs shell quoting,
  but is otherwise taken verbatim — commas are not treated as separators, so
  `--add-response-header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST'` is one rule.
* **`Host` cannot be rewritten on the request.** Go carries the request host
  outside the header map, so such a rule would silently do nothing; deploying
  one is rejected instead.
* **Names and values are validated at deploy time.** A malformed name, or a
  value containing a newline (which would smuggle in a second header), fails the
  deploy rather than reaching the wire.


### Redirecting and rewriting paths

`--canonical-host` moves a whole service from one host to another. To move a
path — an old URL that now lives somewhere else, or a single-page app serving
its own routes — use `--redirect` and `--rewrite`. A redirect answers the client
with a `Location`; a rewrite changes only the path your app receives, leaving
the browser's URL alone. Both may be given more than once:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 \
      --redirect '/old-page=/new-page' \
      --redirect '/blog/(.*)=/news/$1' \
      --redirect '/shop/(.*)=https://shop.example.com/$1;status=302' \
      --rewrite '/[^.]*=/index.html'

Things worth knowing:

* **The pattern is a regular expression matched against the whole path.**
  `/old-page` fires on `/old-page` and nothing else; write `/old(/.*)?` to cover
  what is below it too. Capture groups expand as `$1` in the replacement.
* **One hop, not two.** A rule naming a path is answered with the scheme and
  host the request was headed for anyway, so `--tls --canonical-host example.com
  --redirect '/old=/new'` sends `http://www.example.com/old` straight to
  `https://example.com/new`.
* **The query survives.** `/blog/hello?page=2` becomes `/news/hello?page=2`,
  unless the replacement carries a query of its own.
* **Redirects are `301` by default.** Add `;status=302` (or `303`, `307`, `308`)
  for anything you may want to take back — browsers cache a `301` for a long
  time.
* **A rule that resolves to the request's own URL is skipped**, so a catch-all
  like `--redirect '/(.*)=/$1'` does not send a client round in circles.
* **Rewrites are the SPA case.** `--rewrite '/[^.]*=/index.html'` hands every
  extensionless path to your app's index while `/assets/app.js` still reaches
  the file. Your app sees the rewritten path; the access log, the metrics and
  the `X-Forwarded-*` headers keep the path the client asked for.
* **Redirects win over rewrites**, and both are evaluated in the order given,
  first match wins.
* **Patterns are compiled at deploy time.** An unparseable expression, a
  replacement that is neither an absolute path nor a full URL, or a status that
  is not a redirect fails the deploy rather than the request.


### Compressing responses

The proxy can encode responses on their way back to the client, so your app does
not have to. Name the encodings you want to offer, most preferred first:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --compress zstd,br,gzip

`gzip`, `br` (brotli) and `zstd` are supported. Only responses the client asked
to have encoded are touched, and the client's `q` values win — the order you give
is the tie-breaker between encodings it likes equally.

Two flags tune what qualifies:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --compress gzip \
      --compress-min-length 2048 \
      --compress-content-type 'text/*,application/json,application/wasm'

Things worth knowing:

* **A response is left alone unless it will benefit.** The proxy skips anything
  your app already encoded, media types outside the compressible list, bodies
  under `--compress-min-length` (1024 bytes by default), `204`/`304` responses,
  `HEAD` requests, and byte-range replies.
* **The compressible list is an allow list.** `text/*`, JSON, XML, JavaScript,
  WASM and SVG by default, plus any `+json`/`+xml` vendor type. Anything the
  proxy does not recognise is assumed to be compressed already — images, video,
  fonts and archives all pass through. `--compress-content-type` replaces the
  list outright, and accepts exact types or a `type/*` wildcard.
* **Event streams are never compressed**, so `text/event-stream` keeps flowing
  a chunk at a time. Name it under `--compress-content-type` to override that.
* **A response flushed before it reaches the minimum is sent as-is.** Once your
  app pushes bytes to the client, the proxy stops holding any back.
* **`Vary: Accept-Encoding` is set on every compressible response**, whether or
  not this particular client got an encoded body, so a cache in front of the
  proxy keeps the two representations apart. A strong `ETag` is weakened to
  `W/"..."` when the body is encoded, for the same reason.
* **The built-in error pages are not compressed.** They are rendered above the
  router, outside any one service's settings. Pages you supply with
  `--error-pages` are compressed like anything else.

### Caching responses

The proxy can hold on to the responses your app marks as shareable and answer
later requests from them, so a hot URL costs the app one request per lifetime
instead of one per client. It is opt-in per service:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --cache

Nothing is stored until your app says so, twice over: the response must carry an
explicit `public` directive **and** a lifetime.

    Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=60
    Cache-Control: public, max-age=60, stale-while-revalidate=600

`s-maxage` wins over `max-age` when both are present — that is exactly what it is
for, telling a shared cache something different from the browser.

#### Sharing one cache across the fleet

By default each proxy keeps its own cache in memory. Point them all at one Redis
and a single fetch warms every node:

    dash-proxy run --cache-store redis://cache-1:6379/0

`--cache-store-timeout` (100ms by default) bounds every read and write. A store
that is slow or down costs you a cache, never a failed request: the lookup reads
as a miss and the request goes to the target as usual. Redis owns expiry, so a
proxy that restarts comes back to a warm cache. `--cache-memory-size` (256MB)
caps the in-process store instead, which evicts least-recently-used first.

#### Surviving a restart without Redis

The in-process store is emptied by a proxy restart. For a single host that is the
difference between an asset served from Go and one fetched from the app again —
and with `--sleep-after`, between a container that stays asleep and one woken to
re-serve a file that has not changed in a year.

A `file://` store keeps entries on disk instead:

    dash-proxy run --cache-store file:///var/lib/dash-proxy/cache

The directory must be a volume that outlives the container, or this does nothing
a restart will notice. `--cache-memory-size` caps it, the same as it caps the
memory store, evicting least-recently-used first. Entries are written to a temp
file and renamed into place, so a crash mid-write leaves nothing a later read can
trip over, and a file that cannot be decoded is dropped rather than making the
cache unopenable.

It is a **single-host** store. Two proxies pointed at one directory each keep
their own index and will fight over it — use Redis for a fleet. For the same
reason it does not coalesce fetches across nodes the way a shared store does;
on one proxy the in-process single flight already does that.

Digested Rails assets are what this is for. They carry
`Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`, so the app serves each one
exactly once and the proxy serves it thereafter — across restarts, deploys, and
naps.

#### Stale while revalidating

With `stale-while-revalidate`, an expired entry keeps answering while the proxy
fetches a fresh copy behind it — nobody waits for the refresh, and only one
refresh runs however many clients arrive at once. The refresh carries the stored
entry's *own* `ETag` or `Last-Modified`, not the validator of whichever client
happened to trigger it — the question is whether that entry is still current. If
your app answers `304`, the entry gets a fresh lifetime and its body never
crosses the wire again.

`must-revalidate` (and `proxy-revalidate`) turn the stale window off, since they
forbid answering from an entry that has passed its lifetime. A response marked
`no-cache` is not stored at all: it would have to be validated before every
reuse, and the proxy has no way to do that on the way out.

#### Seeing what it is holding

    dash-proxy cache stats
    dash-proxy cache stats --count       # measure entries and bytes
    dash-proxy cache stats --json

```
Store        memory (per node)
Entries      12,481
Size         192.0 MB of 256.0 MB (75%)
Evicted      1,918 fresh, 3,204 stale
```

**`Evicted ... fresh` is the number that sizes the cache.** An entry pushed out
with lifetime still on it was fetched and never used up, so a climbing fresh
count with `Size` near the budget means raise `--cache-memory-size`. Stale
evictions alone are a cache doing its job. Zero fresh evictions with `Size` well
under the budget means you can lower it.

`--count` adds a per-service breakdown, which names what is filling the cache.
On a shared `--cache-store` it is not the default because it walks the keyspace
— and it is the only truthful answer a shared store has to "how big is *my*
cache", since the server itself only knows its own totals:

```
Store        redis (shared)
Entries      not counted -- pass --count to measure this proxy's keys
Evicted      0 fresh, 0 stale

Cache server -- shared with anything else using it
Keys         48,201 (every key in the database, not only this proxy's)
Used memory  unknown of unknown, policy unknown
             (used_bytes, max_bytes, eviction_policy withheld by the server)
```

A managed Redis often restricts `INFO`. What it withholds prints as `unknown`
rather than `0`, so nothing is ever sized against a number the server never gave.

#### Purging

    dash-proxy cache purge service1
    dash-proxy cache purge service1 --path-prefix /assets

Things worth knowing:

* **The cache sits below everything that can refuse a request.** Basic auth, the
  allow list, the rate limit, redirects and rewrites all run first, so a stored
  response is only ever handed to a client the target would have been asked for.
  A request carrying an `Authorization` header the proxy is only forwarding never
  touches the cache at all.
* **`Set-Cookie` responses are refused** unless you pass `--cache-allow-set-cookie`.
  Replaying one client's cookie to the next is the worst thing a shared cache
  could do, so it takes a deliberate flag.
* **`GET` and `HEAD` only.** A `HEAD` is answered from the stored `GET` with the
  body dropped, and never populates the cache itself. Range requests, upgrades
  and every other method pass straight through.
* **Concurrent misses collapse into one fetch.** Twenty clients arriving at a
  cold URL together cost the app one request; the rest are answered from what it
  returned. If the response turns out not to be storable they are released
  immediately rather than held behind it.
* **`Vary` is honoured automatically, per URL.** A response naming
  `Vary: Accept` or `Vary: Origin` is stored once per representation, keyed on
  exactly what it varies on — only that URL pays, and only for the dimensions it
  actually negotiates. You no longer need a flag to make a varying endpoint
  cacheable, and fixing one endpoint no longer fragments the whole service.
* **A resource holds at most `--cache-max-variants` representations** (32 by
  default). The proxy can normalise only `Accept-Encoding`; every other dimension
  is keyed on whatever the client sent, so the cap is what stops one careless
  `Vary` filling the cache with near-duplicates. Over the limit the response
  still reaches the client, it is just not stored, and
  `cache_refusals_total{reason="variant_limit"}` says so. `--cache-max-variants -1`
  switches automatic variants off entirely.
* **Some headers are refused outright** — `Cookie`, `Authorization`,
  `User-Agent`, `Referer`. They differ for practically every client, so keying on
  them would store one body per client. `--cache-vary-header` is the override, at
  the cost of putting the header in the key for every path in the service.
  `Vary: *` is never storable.
* **`--cache-vary-cookie` is unchanged**, and deliberately does *not* lift the
  `Vary: Cookie` refusal — it names cookies for the key, which is a different
  question from whether a cookie-varying response may be shared at all.
* **`Accept-Encoding` needs no entry.** The cache stores what your app produced
  and sits inside `--compress`, so one entry serves every encoding. A response
  your app encoded *itself* is not stored by default, since the key does not
  record which encoding it is.
* **If your app does its own compression**, add `--cache-vary-header accept-encoding`
  and those responses become cacheable. The key then carries the *set of codings
  the client accepts*, not the raw header — `gzip, deflate, br`,
  `br;q=0.9, gzip, deflate` and `  GZIP,DEFLATE,BR ` are one client capability
  written three ways and share one entry. Codings the proxy does not know
  (`exi`, `sdch`) are ignored rather than fragmenting the cache, and a response
  encoded with one of those is not stored at all. Whatever the key says, a
  stored body is never handed to a client that did not accept its encoding.
* **A rollout gets its own entries.** Canary targets are running different code,
  so their responses never answer requests routed to the stable ones.
* **Statuses beyond `200`.** `203`, `204`, `300`, `301`, `308`, `404`, `405`,
  `410`, `414` and `501` are storable too, given the same `public` marking.
  `206` never is. Bodies over `--cache-max-body` (8MB) still reach the client,
  they are just not kept, and `--cache-max-ttl` caps a lifetime your app asks for.
* **Clients can still bypass it.** `Cache-Control: no-cache` on a request fetches
  a fresh copy — and stores it, so a reload warms the entry for everybody else.
  `no-store` skips the cache in both directions.
* **`X-Cache` says what happened** — `HIT`, `MISS` or `STALE` — alongside an
  `Age` header that counts any age the response already had upstream.
* **`kamal_proxy_cache_evictions_total{service,state}` sizes the cache.**
  `state="fresh"` counts entries dropped with lifetime still on them — that is
  the alertable signal that `--cache-memory-size` is too small. `state="stale"`
  climbing on its own is healthy.
* **`kamal_proxy_cache_refusals_total{service,reason}` explains a cold cache.**
  Every response the cache declines to store is counted with the reason —
  `not_public`, `no_lifetime`, `set_cookie`, `vary`, `content_encoding`,
  `too_large`, `status` and so on. If a service sits at 100% miss, this is the
  metric that says why. `--debug` adds a log line per refusal naming the flag or
  target change that would fix it.
* **`kamal_proxy_cache_events_total{service,result}` is the counter.** Exactly
  one of `hit`, `miss`, `stale` and `coalesced` is recorded per request the cache
  considered, so they sum to the request count and
  `hit / (hit + miss + stale + coalesced)` is a real hit rate. `store`, `error`
  and `revalidated` describe what the cache did rather than what a client got,
  and sit outside that sum — a background refresh is not a client miss.


### Automatic TLS

Kamal Proxy can automatically obtain and renew TLS certificates for your
applications. To enable this, add the `--tls` flag when deploying an instance:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --host app1.example.com --tls

Automatic TLS requires that hosts are specified (to ensure that certificates
are not maliciously requests for arbitrary hostnames).

Additionally, when using path-based routing, TLS options must be set on the
root path. Services deployed to other paths on the same host will use the same
TLS settings as those specified for the root path.


### Deploying before a DNS cutover

You can deploy a host before its DNS points at the proxy. Nothing is ordered
from the certificate authority until the first HTTPS request for that hostname
arrives, and before the domain resolves here, an HTTP-01 challenge cannot
succeed — so the proxy checks first, with a cheap request to the domain, that
it actually routes back here. If it does not, the handshake is refused and no
order is spent. That matters: Let's Encrypt allows only five failed
authorizations per hostname per hour, and tripping that limit is what would
otherwise delay the certificate at the moment of the cutover.

Held domains are re-checked every minute (`--acme-release-probe-interval`, or a
negative value to switch it off). As soon as the domain starts routing here,
the hold lifts and the certificate is issued — so the cutover costs about a
minute, not a backoff step.

To watch it happen, or to see why a certificate has not arrived:

    dash-proxy domains list

    SERVICE   DOMAIN            CERTIFIED  HOLD                             REMOVAL HELD
    service1  app.example.com   yes
    service1  new.example.com   no         2026-08-25 14:32:10 (preflight)

A `preflight` hold means the domain does not point here yet — repoint it and
the proxy will pick it up on its own. An `acme` hold means the certificate
authority rejected an order, and lifts the same way. A `rate_limited` hold is
the authority's own window, and waits it out.

Both `domains list` and `domains stats` take `--json` for scripts and the `dash`
gem; the hold shows up under `quarantine.<domain>` with `until`, `failures` and
`kind`.

If you know the cause is already fixed and do not want to wait:

    dash-proxy domains retry new.example.com

Domains covered by a DNS-01 provider skip all of this — see [Wildcard
Certificates](#wildcard-certificates-dns-01-challenge). DNS-01 validation never
depends on where a domain points, so those certificates can be issued days
before a cutover with nothing to check and nothing to wait for.


### On-demand TLS

Instead of specifying a static list of hosts, Kamal Proxy can also obtain TLS
certificates dynamically, for any host approved by an HTTP endpoint of your
choice. This is useful when the full set of hosts is not known at deploy time,
such as when serving customer domains.

To enable this, specify `--tls-on-demand-url` (instead of `--host`) when
deploying:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --tls --tls-on-demand-url="http://localhost:4567/check"

The URL may be:

- An external URL (like `http://localhost:4567/check`), which Kamal Proxy will
  call directly, or
- A path (like `/check`), which Kamal Proxy will route through the service to
  your application, letting the application decide which hosts to allow.

Before issuing a certificate for a host, Kamal Proxy will send a `GET` request
to the endpoint, with the hostname in a `host` query parameter (for example,
`?host=app1.example.com`) and matching `Host` header. Any `2xx` response allows
certificate issuance — `204 No Content` is a perfectly good way to approve.
Anything else denies it, and the status code and up to 256 bytes of the response
body are logged to help with debugging. A redirect is a denial rather than
something to follow, since following it could turn a denial into an approval
from wherever it points. Checks time out after 2 seconds, denying issuance for
that attempt.

A service deployed with `--tls-on-demand-url` owns the issuance decision for
every host it catches: its endpoint is asked before anything else looks at the
name, so a host it denies is never handed to the shared certificate manager.


### Custom TLS certificate

When you obtained your TLS certificate manually, manage your own certificate authority,
or need to install Cloudflare origin certificate, you can manually specify path to
your certificate file and the corresponding private key:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --host app1.example.com --tls --tls-certificate-path cert.pem --tls-private-key-path key.pem


### Mutual TLS (mTLS)

To require that clients present a certificate, pass a PEM bundle of the
certificate authorities they must chain to with `--tls-client-ca-path`.
Connections that present no certificate, or one signed by any other authority,
are rejected during the TLS handshake:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --host app1.example.com --tls --tls-certificate-path cert.pem --tls-private-key-path key.pem --tls-client-ca-path ca.pem

The requirement is per-service and applies to the hosts that service serves, so
services on the same proxy can have different client certificate rules. This is
how you enable [Cloudflare Authenticated Origin
Pulls](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/),
ensuring only Cloudflare can reach your origin.

Note that a service deployed without `--host` — one using `--tls-on-demand-url`
or `--tls-domains-source` — serves every hostname no other service claims, so its
client CA applies to all of them.


### Scale to zero when idle

A service can stop its containers after a period without traffic and start them
again on the next request. On a host running several low-traffic apps this is
the difference between paying for all of them all the time and paying for the
ones someone is actually using — an idle Rails app holds 200–300 MB it is not
using.

Start the proxy with a container runtime socket, then deploy with `--sleep-after`:

    dash-proxy run --docker-socket /var/run/docker.sock
    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --host app.example.com --sleep-after 30m

The first request after the containers stop is held while they start and pass a
health check, then forwarded — body intact, including a chunked POST. Concurrent
requests coalesce into a single start. If the containers do not come up within
`--wake-timeout` (30s by default) the request fails with 503.

> **`--docker-socket` gives the proxy root-equivalent access to the host.** Anyone
> who can execute code in the proxy can control every container on that machine.
> It is off by default and should stay off unless a service uses `--sleep-after`.
> The lifecycle is isolated behind a small interface, so a restricted host-side
> start/stop service can replace direct socket access later.

**What does and does not count as traffic.** Health checks never wake a sleeping
service — an uptime monitor polling `/up` would otherwise pin it awake forever —
and neither do the proxy's own TLS probes. A sleeping service answers its own
health checks with `200`, and reports `503` once a wake has actually failed, so
monitoring reflects reality rather than the last good state.

Requests rejected by `--allow-ip`, `--basic-auth` or `--rate-limit`, and paths
answered by `--redirect`, never reach the containers and so never start them.
Neither does a response served from `--cache`: a cached service can keep serving
while its containers stay stopped.

An open WebSocket or event stream keeps a service awake for as long as it is
open, so a long-lived connection is never cut short by an idle timeout.

**Which container gets stopped.** By default the proxy uses the target's hostname,
which is the container id under Kamal and the container name under Compose. When
a target names something else — a Compose service alias, or an IP address — say
so explicitly:

    dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web:3000 --host app.example.com --sleep-after 30m --sleep-container myapp-web-1

The deploy checks the reference against the runtime and fails immediately if it
names nothing, rather than accepting the deploy and failing at the first idle
timeout an hour later. `dash-proxy list` shows `sleeping` or `waking` in the
state column, and the state survives a proxy restart.

**Known limitation.** `kamal deploy` prunes stopped containers, and a sleeping
container is stopped. Kamal 2 releases before the per-role prune fix can remove
one, after which every wake fails until the service is redeployed.


### Minimum TLS version

The HTTPS listener negotiates TLS 1.2 and above by default. To refuse TLS 1.2 as
well and serve only TLS 1.3, start the proxy with `--min-tls` (or the `MIN_TLS`
environment variable):

    dash-proxy run --min-tls 1.3

Accepted values are `1.2` and `1.3`. TLS 1.0 and 1.1 cannot be enabled — they are
deprecated by [RFC 8996](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8996) and Go's TLS
stack already declines to serve them, so the proxy refuses to start rather than
pretend the setting took effect. The `tls1_2` / `tls1_3` spellings are accepted
too, so a configuration written against upstream dash-proxy keeps working.

This is a listener-wide setting: it applies to every service, including hosts
that require client certificates. The HTTP/3 listener is always TLS 1.3, since
QUIC is only defined over TLS 1.3 ([RFC 9001](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001)),
and `--min-tls` neither lowers nor raises it.

Raising the minimum locks out clients that cannot reach it, and they fail during
the handshake — before the request reaches the HTTP layer, so nothing appears in
the access log. Check what your clients actually negotiate before setting `1.3`.

Cipher suites are deliberately not configurable. Go does not allow selecting TLS
1.3 cipher suites at all, and its TLS 1.2 defaults already exclude the RC4, 3DES
and static-RSA suites that a hardening baseline asks you to remove — so a cipher
flag could only weaken the proxy, while silently doing nothing on TLS 1.3.


### SAN Certificate Batching

When started with `--acme-email` (or the `ACME_EMAIL` environment variable),
Kamal Proxy batches multiple domains into a single SAN (Subject Alternative Name)
certificate. This dramatically reduces the number of certificates needed and helps
avoid Let's Encrypt rate limits.

Without `--acme-email`, Kamal Proxy falls back to issuing separate certificates
per service using the standard autocert flow.

**How it works:**

1. When services with TLS enabled are deployed, domains are queued for certificate provisioning
2. All pending domains (up to 100) are batched into a single certificate request
3. The resulting SAN certificate covers all domains, regardless of their root domain

**Example:**

```bash
dash-proxy deploy app1 --target web-1:3000 --host app.example.com --tls
dash-proxy deploy app2 --target web-2:3000 --host api.other.org --tls
dash-proxy deploy app3 --target web-3:3000 --host mysite.net --tls
# → All three services share a single certificate with SANs:
#   app.example.com, api.other.org, mysite.net
```

**Rate limit impact:**

| Domains | Without batching | With SAN batching |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| 10      | 10 certificates  | 1 certificate     |
| 100     | 100 certificates | 1 certificate     |
| 1000    | 1000 certificates| 10 certificates   |

**Benefits:**

- **Dramatic reduction**: Up to 100 domains per certificate
- **Rate limit friendly**: 1000 domains = 10 certs instead of 1000
- **Any domains**: Works across different root domains
- **Minimal configuration**: Set `--acme-email` once, then deploy with `--tls` as usual

**Configuration options:**

| Flag | Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|------|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `--acme-email` | `ACME_EMAIL` | (required for SAN batching) | Contact email for Let's Encrypt |
| `--acme-directory` | `ACME_DIRECTORY` | Let's Encrypt production | ACME directory URL |

**Using Let's Encrypt staging environment:**

For testing, use the staging environment to avoid rate limits:

```bash
dash-proxy run --acme-email admin@example.com \
  --acme-directory https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
```


### Dynamic domains with automatic TLS

SaaS apps that host many customer domains usually only know the full domain
list at runtime, in their own database. With a *domain source*, Kamal Proxy
learns that list from the app itself and fully manages certificates for it:
proactive throttled issuance, background renewal (ARI), per-domain failure
quarantine, and eviction when a domain is removed. A domain added in the app
serves HTTPS within minutes — no deploys, config edits, or restarts.

Requires running with `--acme-email`. Enable per service at deploy time:

```bash
dash-proxy deploy service1 --target web-1:3000 --tls \
  --tls-domains-source /api/v1/domains
```

The source is polled every 5 minutes (`--tls-domains-interval` to change,
minimum 10s), resolved against a healthy target of the service — or use an
absolute `http(s)://` URL. `ETag`/`If-None-Match` are honored. The endpoint
must return:

```json
{"domains": ["customer1.com", "www.customer2.org"]}
```

Wildcard entries (`*.example.com`) are skipped — the proxy decides on its own
when a zone's names are better served by a wildcard, see [Wildcards for
dynamic domains](#wildcards-for-dynamic-domains) — invalid hostnames are
skipped, and payloads over 1MB or 10,000 entries are rejected.
Set `DASH_PROXY_DOMAINS_TOKEN` to send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` with
each poll. (`KAMAL_PROXY_DOMAINS_TOKEN` is still read as a fallback, as are
the `KAMAL_PROXY_` forms of the other two tokens below.)

A service with a domain source must be the catch-all: deploy it without
`--host` (dynamic domains route through the host-less binding, so `--tls` no
longer requires one). The fetched list is a hard allowlist — TLS handshakes
for unknown hostnames are refused without touching Let's Encrypt.

**Push refresh (optional).** To pick up new domains faster than the poll
interval, set `DASH_PROXY_REFRESH_TOKEN` on the proxy and have the app nudge
it after changing domains:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $DASH_PROXY_REFRESH_TOKEN" \
  http://proxy-host/.kamal-proxy/domains/refresh
```

The nudge carries no data — it just triggers an immediate re-poll (202). It
answers 401 for bad tokens, 404 when unconfigured, and 429 more than once per
10s.

**Certificates and Let's Encrypt limits.** Dynamic domains are issued
per-domain by default, throttled well under Let's Encrypt's account limits
(burst of 20 orders, then one per 40s, max 3 in flight). Before a domain's
first order, the proxy probes `http://<domain>/.kamal-proxy/preflight/<nonce>`
to verify DNS actually routes here — unreachable domains are quarantined
(5m, then 15m → 1h → 4h → 24h backoff) without burning an order. A held
domain is re-probed every minute and its hold lifts as soon as it routes
here, so a backoff step is a ceiling rather than a wait; only a hold the
certificate authority imposed (rate limiting) runs to its own end time.
Failing domains quarantine alone; the rest of a batch is retried once. Renewals reuse
the exact same identifier set (exempt from most rate limits) and pass ARI
`replaces` where supported. Every renewal re-probes its dynamic members
first, so a tenant whose DNS moved away after issuance is quarantined out of
the order instead of failing it — and when an order fails without naming a
domain, the members are probed to find the culprit before anyone is blamed.

**A bad poll cannot destroy certificates.** Two guards protect the estate
from the source itself. A poll that removes more than 30% of the applied
domain set has its removals *held*: the previous set stays allowed (additions
still apply), and only three consecutive shrunken polls confirm and apply the
removal — a single (or transient) empty or truncated response from the app
evicts nothing. Held removals are visible in `dash-proxy domains list`
(Removal held column) and logged at Warn on every held poll. Independently, a
certificate whose domains were all evicted is never deleted before its own
expiry: it stops renewing but keeps serving, and can be reused immediately if
the domains return before it expires — normal replacement and renewal rules
still apply.

`--tls-domains-batch-size` (max 25) opts into stable SAN batching for dynamic
domains: batches fill append-only, and membership only changes at renewal
boundaries. Note that batching publishes all tenants of a batch together in
certificate-transparency logs, and one dead domain can hold up its batch —
per-domain (the default) is recommended.

The last fetched list and quarantine state persist in
`dynamic-domains.state`, so certificates keep serving after a restart even if
the app is down.

**Inspecting:**

```bash
dash-proxy domains list           # every domain, cert + hold + held-removal status
dash-proxy domains stats          # counters: domains, certified, queued, quarantined, held
dash-proxy domains refresh        # trigger an immediate re-poll of all sources
dash-proxy domains retry <domain> # clear an issuance hold and try again now
```

Holds lift on their own once a domain routes back to the proxy — see
[Deploying before a DNS cutover](#deploying-before-a-dns-cutover). `retry` is
for when you already know the cause is fixed and would rather not wait.


### Wildcard Certificates (DNS-01 Challenge)

For deployments with many subdomains, you can use wildcard certificates to avoid
Let's Encrypt rate limits. Wildcard certificates require DNS-01 challenge, which
needs access to your DNS provider's API.

**Supported DNS Providers:**

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: dns-provider-table (go generate ./internal/server/acme/providers) -->
| Name | Provider | Credentials | Optional |
|------|----------|-------------|----------|
| `cloudflare` | [Cloudflare](https://go-acme.github.io/lego/dns/cloudflare/) | `CF_DNS_API_TOKEN` or `CLOUDFLARE_DNS_API_TOKEN` or (`CF_API_KEY` + `CF_API_EMAIL`) or (`CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` + `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL`) | `CF_ZONE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_API_TOKEN` |
| `digitalocean` | [DigitalOcean](https://go-acme.github.io/lego/dns/digitalocean/) | `DO_AUTH_TOKEN` | — |

**Enabling wildcard certificates:**

1. Set DNS provider credentials as environment variables
2. Start dash-proxy with ACME email configured:

```bash
export CF_DNS_API_TOKEN=your-cloudflare-token
dash-proxy run --acme-email admin@example.com --acme-dns-provider cloudflare
```

3. Deploy services as normal - wildcards are provisioned automatically:

```bash
dash-proxy deploy app --target web-1:3000 --host app.example.com --tls
dash-proxy deploy api --target web-2:3000 --host api.example.com --tls
# → Both services share a *.example.com wildcard certificate
```

**How certificate grouping works:**

When you deploy services with TLS enabled, dash-proxy automatically:

1. Groups domains by their root domain (e.g., `app.example.com` and `api.example.com` → `example.com`)
2. When 2+ subdomains share a root domain, provisions a wildcard certificate (`*.example.com`)
3. Shares the wildcard certificate across all matching services
4. Falls back to individual certificates for unrelated domains

This dramatically reduces the number of certificates needed and avoids Let's Encrypt
rate limits (50 certificates per registered domain per week).

**ACME configuration options:**

| Flag | Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|------|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `--acme-email` | `ACME_EMAIL` | (required) | Contact email for Let's Encrypt |
| `--acme-dns-provider` | `ACME_DNS_PROVIDER` | none | DNS provider for DNS-01 challenges — any name from the supported-providers table above, `auto` to detect from environment credentials, or `none`. DNS-01 activates only when this is set explicitly; `auto` logs the provider it resolved at boot. Repeatable; `zone=provider` entries pin a zone to its DNS host |
| `--acme-directory` | `ACME_DIRECTORY` | Let's Encrypt production | ACME directory URL |
| `--acme-prefer-wildcard` | `ACME_PREFER_WILDCARD` | `true` | Prefer wildcard certificates when DNS provider available |
| `--acme-http-fallback` | `ACME_HTTP_FALLBACK` | `true` | Fall back to HTTP-01 challenge if DNS-01 fails |

**Zones at different DNS hosts:**

A fleet that terminates TLS for several zones often has them registered at
different DNS providers. `--acme-dns-provider` is repeatable: `zone=provider`
entries pin a zone to the DNS host that serves it, and one bare entry is the
default for anything no zone matches.

```bash
export CF_DNS_API_TOKEN=your-cloudflare-token
export HETZNER_API_KEY=your-hetzner-key
dash-proxy run --acme-email admin@example.com \
  --acme-dns-provider platform.example=cloudflare \
  --acme-dns-provider legacy.example=hetzner
```

The provider for each certificate order is chosen by longest matching zone
suffix, and one order never spans providers — a batch that would is split
along provider boundaries. Every mapped provider validates its credentials at
startup, so a mapping naming a provider whose credentials are absent fails the
boot rather than the first issuance. Mappings are always explicit: `auto` can
only be the bare default. The same syntax works in the environment variable,
comma-separated: `ACME_DNS_PROVIDER=platform.example=cloudflare,hetzner`.

**Wildcards for dynamic domains**

The grouping above applies to `--host` names. A name learned from a
`--tls-domains-source` is tenant-owned and may sit in any zone, so the proxy
never guesses a wildcard for it from DNS structure alone — that is how a
foreign-zone name can end up in an order nothing can validate. Dynamic names
collapse under exactly one signal: a `zone=provider` mapping. Mapping a zone
is the operator asserting DNS control over it, and with `--acme-prefer-wildcard`
(the default) every single-label name directly under a mapped zone is ordered
as that zone's wildcard, with the apex and deeper names riding the same order
as concrete identifiers. The default provider and `auto` never collapse a
dynamic name.

```bash
dash-proxy run --acme-email admin@example.com --acme-dns-provider platform.example=cloudflare
dash-proxy deploy app --target web-1:3000 --tls --tls-domains-source /api/v1/domains
# {"domains": ["a.platform.example", "b.platform.example", "platform.example", "customer.net"]}
# → one order for *.platform.example + platform.example (DNS-01), one for customer.net (HTTP-01)
```

A name the wildcard covers — including one that appears in the source later —
is served from it without an order. Adopting a wildcard also takes over every
covered name that was certified on its own, so those certificates retire at
the next renewal check instead of renewing forever; a zone that was certified
one name at a time converges on its wildcard the first time any of its names
renews. A wildcard order that fails does not take the zone off the air: the
wildcard identifier backs off on the quarantine ladder, and the names it
covered retry once as concrete identifiers, where `--acme-http-fallback` can
still answer. `dash-proxy domains list` shows the covered names as certified;
the wildcard itself is visible in the metrics gauge for wildcard certificates.

**Using Let's Encrypt staging environment:**

For testing, use the staging environment to avoid rate limits:

```bash
dash-proxy run --acme-email admin@example.com --acme-dns-provider cloudflare \
  --acme-directory https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
```

**Which names get a certificate**

Automatic TLS is deliberately not on-demand. Kamal Proxy will only ask Let's
Encrypt for a name that is on its allowlist, which is exactly:

- a `--host` on a service deployed with `--tls`, and
- a domain returned by a service's `--tls-domains-source`.

Any other server name presented in a TLS handshake is refused, and costs no ACME
order — including under a catch-all service, which routes every name. Without
that gate, anyone who points a DNS record at the proxy's IP could drive real
issuance against your ACME account by sending that name as SNI, and burn the
account's rate limit in the process.

Issuance is rate limited on top of the allowlist: one shared token bucket
(20 orders of burst, refilling one per 40 seconds — about 250 per 3 hours,
under Let's Encrypt's 300) covers every path, whether an order comes from a
handshake, from a domains source, or from renewal.

If you want a name approved at handshake time by your own application rather
than at deploy time, that is what [on-demand TLS](#on-demand-tls) is for. Your
endpoint answers `2xx` to approve, anything else to deny.

### Backing up and restoring certificates

All certificate state lives on the proxy node's disk: the ACME account key,
every issued certificate with its private key, the domain-to-certificate
mappings, and the dynamic domain list. Losing that disk means re-issuing the
whole estate under the issuance rate limit (about 250 orders per 3 hours) —
for a large estate, hours of hard TLS failures. Export makes node loss a
restore instead of an outage:

```bash
dash-proxy export certs /backup/certs-$(date +%F).tar.gz
```

With the proxy running, the snapshot is taken through the proxy, under the
same lock the certificate managers use for writes, so a backup taken
mid-renewal is never torn. With no proxy reachable on its socket, the data
directory is read directly — only do that when the proxy is actually stopped.

**The archive contains private keys** — every certificate key and the ACME
account key. It is written with mode `0600`; store and transfer it as the
secret it is.

Backups are only as good as their last verification. `--verify` parses every
certificate in an archive and reports domains and expiries without touching
the store, so a cron job or CI can check each backup as it is taken:

```bash
dash-proxy import certs --archive /backup/certs-2026-08-09.tar.gz --verify
```

**Restore runbook** (new node, rebuilt host, or a volume mistake):

1. Stop the proxy.
2. Restore the estate: `dash-proxy import certs --archive /backup/certs-2026-08-09.tar.gz`
   (add `--data-dir` if the proxy runs with one). The import refuses to
   overwrite a non-empty certificate store unless you pass `--force`.
3. If you keep a backup of the routing state (`dash-proxy.state`), restore
   it now, while the proxy is still stopped — the proxy saves routing state
   on changes, so a copy restored after startup would be overwritten.
4. Start the proxy. If no routing state was restored, redeploy your TLS
   services — the archive holds certificates, not routes, and the proxy
   refuses a TLS handshake for a host no service is deployed for.
5. Verify a restored static host with a TLS handshake; the certificate expiry
   metrics should show the restored estate, with no new ACME orders.
   (`dash-proxy domains list` covers only dynamic `--tls-domains-source`
   domains.)

Restores run offline against the data directory, sharing their writing path
with the Traefik `acme.json` importer (`import certs --traefik-acme`), so
there is one code path that knows how to populate the store correctly.

A multi-node shared certificate store is deliberately not what this is: with
single-node TLS termination plus backups, losing the node is a restore, not
an outage.


## Specifying `run` options with environment variables

In some environments, like when running a Docker container, it can be convenient
to specify `run` options using environment variables. This avoids having to
update the `CMD` in the Dockerfile to change the options. To support this,
`dash-proxy run` will read each of its options from environment variables if they
are set. For example, setting the HTTP port can be done with either:

    dash-proxy run --http-port 8080

or:

    HTTP_PORT=8080 dash-proxy run

If any of the environment variables conflict with something else in your
environment, you can prefix them with `KAMAL_PROXY_` to disambiguate them. For
example:

    KAMAL_PROXY_HTTP_PORT=8080 dash-proxy run


## Configuring with Kamal

When using dash-proxy with [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/), you can configure
the proxy through your `deploy.yml` file.

### Enabling Wildcard Certificates in Kamal

To use wildcard certificates with Kamal, add the DNS provider credentials and
ACME configuration to your proxy settings:

```yaml
# deploy.yml

proxy:
  ssl: true
  host: app.example.com
  # Additional hosts will share the wildcard certificate
  # hosts:
  #   - api.example.com
  #   - admin.example.com

# Pass environment variables to the dash-proxy container
env:
  clear:
    # ACME configuration (required for wildcard certs)
    ACME_EMAIL: admin@example.com
    ACME_DNS_PROVIDER: cloudflare

  secret:
    # DNS provider credentials (from .kamal/secrets)
    - CF_DNS_API_TOKEN
```

### Setting up secrets

Create or update `.kamal/secrets` with your DNS provider credentials:

```bash
# .kamal/secrets
CF_DNS_API_TOKEN=your-cloudflare-api-token
```

For AWS Route53:
```bash
# .kamal/secrets
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

### Complete example with multiple services

```yaml
# deploy.yml
service: myapp

servers:
  web:
    hosts:
      - 192.168.1.1
    proxy:
      ssl: true
      host: app.example.com

  api:
    hosts:
      - 192.168.1.1
    proxy:
      ssl: true
      host: api.example.com

env:
  clear:
    ACME_EMAIL: admin@example.com
    ACME_DNS_PROVIDER: cloudflare
    ACME_PREFER_WILDCARD: true

  secret:
    - CF_DNS_API_TOKEN
```

With this configuration:
- Both `app.example.com` and `api.example.com` will share a `*.example.com` wildcard certificate
- Certificate is automatically provisioned and renewed
- No rate limiting issues with Let's Encrypt

### Troubleshooting

**Certificate not provisioning:**
- Check DNS provider credentials are correct
- Ensure the DNS API can create TXT records in your zone
- Check dash-proxy logs: `docker logs dash-proxy`

**Using staging environment for testing:**
```yaml
env:
  clear:
    ACME_EMAIL: admin@example.com
    ACME_DNS_PROVIDER: cloudflare
    ACME_DIRECTORY: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
```
